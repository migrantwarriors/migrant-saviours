## Short description

### What's the problem?

Integrate Migrant Workers’ skillset for local employment with refined Data Bank.
Right now, the unresolved problem is that there is no efficient way to collect or access data of migrants which can be used by government and non-government bodies so that they could roll out their benefit plans to them directly. This leads to a huge gap between Employment service & Labourers. 

### Our innovative solution

A technologically enabled solution to collect, save and prepare a data bank of the Migrant Labourers with their skillset along with their personal and demographic details. This would result in below benefits:
•	Uplifting of Migrant labourers economic and social status.
•	Revival of MSME sector.
•	Better utilization of various resources and funds for the welfare.
•	Reduce migration of labourers to overall reduce the possibilities of COVID spread. 
•	Provide employment opportunities to people so they could stay along with their families.
